## zeply-code-challenge

In this challenge we want you to build a simple app, using either ReactJS or React Native,
which retrieves address and transaction information from the BTC blockchain. It also allows a
user to subscribe for changes to specific hashes. Each subscribed hash should generate a
notification on the UI. Furthermore, the user should be able to select in which currency the
values should be displayed (USD, EUR or BTC).
